# Intermediate Python stuff to learn

<b>When learning Python, it can be helpful to start by learning some basic algorithms and data structures. Here are a few algorithms and data structures that you may find useful when starting out with Python:</b>

- Sorting algorithms: These algorithms allow you to arrange elements in a list in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Some common sorting algorithms in Python include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.

- Search algorithms: These algorithms allow you to find an element in a list or data structure. Some common search algorithms in Python include linear search and binary search.

- Data structures: These are specialized types of data that can store and organize data in an efficient manner. Some common data structures in Python include lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

- Recursion: This is a programming technique where a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem. Recursion can be a useful tool for solving problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems.

- Dynamic programming: This is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid computing them multiple times.

- Graph algorithms: These algorithms allow you to work with graphs, which are collections of interconnected nodes or vertices. Some common graph algorithms in Python include breadth-first search and depth-first search.

- String manipulation algorithms: These algorithms allow you to work with strings, which are sequences of characters. Some common string manipulation algorithms in Python include string reversal, string searching, and string formatting.

<b>By learning these algorithms and data structures, you will gain a strong foundation in Python programming and be well-prepared to tackle more advanced topics.</b>
