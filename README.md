### :floppy_disk: Intermediate Python stuff to learn

<b>When learning Python, it can be helpful to start by learning some basic algorithms and data structures. Here are a few algorithms and data structures that you may find useful when starting out with Python:</b>

- Sorting algorithms: These algorithms allow you to arrange elements in a list in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Some common sorting algorithms in Python include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.

- Search algorithms: These algorithms allow you to find an element in a list or data structure. Some common search algorithms in Python include linear search and binary search.

- Data structures: These are specialized types of data that can store and organize data in an efficient manner. Some common data structures in Python include lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

- Recursion: This is a programming technique where a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem. Recursion can be a useful tool for solving problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems.

- Dynamic programming: This is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid computing them multiple times.

- Graph algorithms: These algorithms allow you to work with graphs, which are collections of interconnected nodes or vertices. Some common graph algorithms in Python include breadth-first search and depth-first search.

- String manipulation algorithms: These algorithms allow you to work with strings, which are sequences of characters. Some common string manipulation algorithms in Python include string reversal, string searching, and string formatting.

<b>By learning these algorithms and data structures, you will gain a strong foundation in Python programming and be well-prepared to tackle more advanced topics.</b>

### :heart: Fun TODO's you can try with Python

- A simple game: You can use Python's built-in turtle module to create a simple game like Pong or Snake.

- A web scraper: Use Python's Beautiful Soup library to scrape data from a website and save it to a file or database.

- A chatbot: Use Python's NLTK library to build a chatbot that can carry on a conversation with users.

- A data visualizer: Use Python's Matplotlib or Seaborn library to create charts and graphs to visualize data.

- A machine learning model: Use Python's scikit-learn library to build a machine learning model to make predictions based on data.

- A web application: Use Python's Flask or Django framework to build a simple web application that allows users to input data or interact with a database.

- A desktop application: Use Python's Tkinter library to build a graphical user interface for a desktop application.

- A data analysis tool: You can use Python's pandas library to analyze and visualize data from a CSV file or a database.

- A simple GUI: You can use Python's tkinter library to build a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for a desktop application.
